# Verification process endpoint + Verify API

**Before you continue**: We don't promise that you'll get an verified
badge for your accounts elsewhere. We just confirm the authencity of
an content creator or publisher through this API.

This repository stores public metadata about an content creator
or publisher as an way to verify their identity across our
platforms and within The Pins Team's communities. It also includes
an source code for the Verify API that anyone can use and integrate
with other apps and services and even self-hosting is supported.

## Getting started

Currently, the process is manual, but if you want to help us automate
it, send us an merge request.

And if you want to get started, our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and [the documentaion](#documentation) is all you need to read.

## API Server development

The API server for the `verify.recaptime.tk` is currently WIP.
Come back for updates.

## Documentation

The documentation for both contributors and maintainers is available
at [the repoistory's wiki](https://github.com/RecapTime/verify/wiki).
Feel free to contribute, as long as its useful for the future of the
project.

## Privacy policy

The Pins Team and its project maintainers of this repoistory will only collect public information about an content creator such as screen name, YouTube/Twitch channel URL,
Twitter handle, real name (if applicable) and domain/website for purposes of verifying the authenicity of an content creator.

Any private information collected during the process will be kept private in accordrance with the privacy policy found at <https://legal.madebythepins.tk/privacy-policy>.
