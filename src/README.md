# Source Files for the API

This directory is where the necessary files such as status history and latest verification status
in JSON files. [Visit the docs](https://github.com/RecapTime/verify/wiki) for details.

## Just a small note

Only static files such as request metadata and status history in JSON are allowed.

For real-time checks, use the `runChecks` (WIP) method.
